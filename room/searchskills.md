Task 8 asks me to create notes of various search engine as theyll be convieniet so here are they

# Some cool stuff i didnt know

## Specialised search engines

[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), sarch engine for devices connected to internet, wow dope maybe i have some of my iot/home lab stuff exposed here.

[Censys](https://search.censys.io/) focuses more on internet connected hosts like router etc

honorable mention [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) and [haveibeenpawned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

## look up official man/technical docs

almost everything esp popular tech will have them, just add man or docs to search with the command we want for example to learn morek, or ofc offline, use the `man` command

e.g: [Microsoft tech docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/) or [Linux](https://linux.die.net/)

# Stuff i know but revised

## CVE and exploit databases.

[CVE](https://www.cve.org/), [Exploit database](https://www.exploit-db.com/), and Github itself.

useful stuff ofc, should use them as inspo or learn from it


## Use search engines operator.

work smart basically

## Use social media to ur advantage

people share too much, create temp account, delete data immediately, maybe use vm + tor as well then

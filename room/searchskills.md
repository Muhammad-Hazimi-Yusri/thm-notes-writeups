# Some cool stuff i didnt know

## Specialised search engines

[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), sarch engine for devices connected to internet, wow dope maybe i have some of my iot/home lab stuff exposed here.

[Censys](https://search.censys.io/) focuses more on internet connected hosts like router etc

honorable mention [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) and [haveibeenpawned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

# Stuff i know but revised

## CVE and exploit databases.

useful stuff ofc, should use them as inspo or learn from it

## Use search engines operator.

work smart basically

## Use social media to ur advantage

people share too much, create temp account, delete data immediately, maybe use vm + tor as well then
